<h2> Calculator </h2>

The 'eval' applet will evaluate simple mathematical expressions.  
For example:
<p>
<ul>
3*4+5^2/7  <br>
sin 2 pi   <br>
sqrt 1.3   <br>
</ul>
<p>
monadic operators have the same functions as those in J:
<p>
<ul>
+48.7 = 48.7 <br>
- -2 = 2 <br>
/3 = 1/3 <br>
*-4 = -1 (signum) <br>
^ 3 = e^3
</ul>
<p>

<h2> Equation Grapher </h2>

The equation grapher uses the same syntax as the calculator
to plot equations in cartesian or polar coordinates.
Which one you get is determined by the "y=" / "r=" choice on the left.
<p>
The grapher expects equations solved in terms of y or r, 
as a function of x or theta respectively.  Note that you
may plot several equations at once, and that you may move
the position of the graph by dragging it.
<p>
The scale adjustement (at the bottom) is a magnification
factor, with '1' being 1 pixel per unit.  The larger the 
magnification, the bigger the picture. 
<p>
sample equations: 
<p>
<ul>
y= -x^3 + 3x^2 + 7x - 7<br>
y= x + 5 sin x <br>
y=sqrt 256 - x^2<br>
y=(sin x) + (sin 2x) / 2 + (sin 3x) / 3 + (sin 4x) / 4<br>
<p>
r= 2 + sin 5 theta
r= sin  3 theta<br>
r= 7 sin theta/2

</ul>
